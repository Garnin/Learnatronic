# Learnatronic working title, dumb on purpose
Learn anything faster than normal.

The goal of this project is to creat a flexible platform for learning any subject with the ability to leverage prior knowledge to learn key concepts faster. All modules should have proper learning sequence prioritizing the most practical 20% of a given subject matter. Spaced repitition, interleaved practice, frequent quizing, and reflection are all principals that will be used to increase information retention.
